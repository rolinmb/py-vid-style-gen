Using python and machine learning / stylegan type neural net to generate videos from specified training content. Made with the help of ChatGPT.

TODO:
    - Doesn't log in real time; only logs everything at the end of execution (flush somehow?)

    - Output file is corrupted (maybe just use ffmpeg like the good old times)

    - Sometimes create extraneous folder depth when creating frames/training; or I dont understand how this works yet.
