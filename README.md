Using python and machine learning / stylegan type neural net to generate videos from specified training content. Made with the help of ChatGPT.

TODO:

    * Sometimes create extraneous folder depth when creating frames/training; or I dont understand how this works yet.

    * I only got it to training epoch 38/100 but I got bored and wanted to make music instead. probably works if you have a better GPU than me
